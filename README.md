## About the Project

Adventuro is a crowdfunding project where a user can donate money to adventures they find interesting, a user can also create their own adventure to be funded. Any extra money donated is given to a charity of the adventurers choice.

## Motivation:

I created Adventuro after spending the past 6 years working, travelling, and adventuring. Doing everything from riding a  49cc moped from Alaska to NYC, to riding a bicycle the length of New Zealand. I believe everybody should have the opportunity to go on a crazy adventure in their lifetime. Adventuring is an opportunity to cultivate wild stories and experiences that you will remember forever, and I don't think enough young people do it.

### Technologies:

Adventuro uses React, Redux with Thunk, React Active Storage Provider, Material-UI, Bcrypt with localStorage, and React Router. It was using AWS to store photo's, but currently uses local storage.

### Back End
