## About the Project

Adventuro is a passion project where a user can donate money to adventures they find interesting. A user can also create their own adventure to be funded. Any extra money donated is given to a charity of the adventures choice.

### What it uses

It is built with React, Redux, withRouter, Bcrypt with localStorage, was using AWS but now uses local server storage, and Material UI. It connects with a Rails back end, and consumes the JSON API's.

### Back End
